# Qiskit-Finance-Portfolio-Optimization-Project
Senior Capstone project, combining Qiskit Finance and PyPortfolioOpt. Would not use this for any financial purposes!! Did my best trying to learn quantum computing, so please cut me some slack

* Qiskit Finance: https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-finance
* PyPortFolioOpt: https://github.com/robertmartin8/PyPortfolioOpt

plotting.py is code from PyPortfolioOpt, with slight changes to handle errors
